# FaceMultiLabelLearning

Compatible from pytorch 0.3.0 onwards.

Repository to reproduce the results of Steinar Laenen's Capstone thesis

This repository contains the training files and scripts. For the dataset and the trained models, please send an e-mail and I will send them.


The script that has to be run is the training script for the net8 models referred to in the paper. To reproduce, adjust the filename for the dataset location.
